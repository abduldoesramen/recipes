    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges. Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold.</p>
    <p>I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen. These grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
      <li>2 tablspoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
      <li>450 grams ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
      <li>4 6-inch sqaures parchment paper</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
      <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
    </ul>
